# Next + Netlify Starter

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/46648482-644c-4c80-bafb-872057e51b6b/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/next-dev-starter/deploys)

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) v12 project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) and set up to be instantly deployed to [Netlify](https://url.netlify.com/SyTBPVamO)!

This project is a very minimal starter that includes 2 sample components, a global stylesheet, a `netlify.toml` for deployment, and a `jsconfig.json` for setting up absolute imports and aliases. It also includes the [Essential Next.js Build Plugin](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-plugin-nextjs), which will allow for you to implement features like Preview Mode, server-side rendering/incremental static regeneration via Netlify Functions, and internationalized routing.

(If you click this button, it will create a new repo for you that looks exactly like this one, and sets that repo up immediately for deployment on Netlify)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

### Installation options

**Option one:** One-click deploy

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/netlify-templates/next-netlify-starter&utm_source=github&utm_medium=nextstarter-cs&utm_campaign=devex-cs)

**Option two:** Manual clone

1. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/netlify-templates/next-netlify-starter.git`
2. Navigate to the directory and run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run dev`
4. Make your changes
5. Connect to [Netlify](https://url.netlify.com/Bk4UicocL) manually (the `netlify.toml` file is the one you'll need to make sure stays intact to make sure the export is done and pointed to the right stuff)

## Redirects

In the [`netlify.toml`](./netlify.toml) configuration file there is an example of how to implement redirects. Redirects can be used to do many things from redirecting Single Page Apps more predictably, redirecting based on country/language to leveraging On-Demand Builders for [Distributed Persistant Rendering](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2021/04/14/distributed-persistent-rendering-a-new-jamstack-approach-for-faster-builds/). 

In the example we'll be using redirects to have a shorter endpoint to Netlify functions. By default, you call a Netlify function when requesting a path like `https://yoursite.netlify.com/.netlify/functions/functionName`. Instead, we'll redirect all calls from a path including `/api` to call on the Netlify functions. So the path will be `https://yoursite.netlify.com/api/functionName`, a lot easier to remember too. 


### Example
```toml
[[redirects]]
from = "/api/*"
to = "/.netlify/functions/:splat"
status = 200
force = true
```

First we create a section in the `.toml` for the redirect using `[[redirects]]`. Each redirect should have this line to start the redirect code, and the redirects will be executed in the order they appear in the `.toml` from top to bottom.

The bare minimum needed is the `from` and `to`, letting the [CDN](https://www.netlify.com/blog/edge-cdn-serverless-cloud-meaaning) know when a route is requested, the `from`, forward it on to another path, the `to`. In the example, we also added an 'Ok' status code, 200, and set the `force` to true to make sure it _always_ redirects from the `from` path.

There are many ways to use redirects. Check out the resouces below to learn more.
